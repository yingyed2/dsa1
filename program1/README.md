ECE-264 (Data Structures and Algorithms I) Program #1: Foobar

Practice of object-oriented programming (OOP):

1. Classes and Objects: Use of classes to encapsulate data and behavior

2. Inheritance & Polymorphism: Derived classes inherit from the base class, extending or overwriting functionality

3. Access Specifiers: Controlled access to class members, ensuring proper encapsulation

4. File I/O: Reading and writing to external sources

5. Dynamic Memory Allocation: Use of a vector class and cleanUp func to prevent memory leaks

Compile steps:

g++ -o main main.cpp
./main
